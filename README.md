## Customizing Sounds

You can customize the death sounds by replacing the audio files in the `sounds` folder:

- `warrior_death.ogg`
- `paladin_death.ogg`
- `hunter_death.ogg`
- `rogue_death.ogg`
- `priest_death.ogg`
- `dk_death.ogg`
- `shaman_death.ogg`
- `mage_death.ogg`
- `warlock_death.ogg`
- `druid_death.ogg`
- `fall_death.ogg`

Simply replace any of these .ogg files with your own sound files (must be in .ogg format and use the same filenames).
